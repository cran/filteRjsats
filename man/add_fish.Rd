\title{Add Fish Data from ERDAPP to a Detection Dataframe}
\usage{
add_fish(prefilter_file, fish)
}
\arguments{
\item{prefilter_file}{a prefiltered detection dataframe from prefilter()}

\item{fish}{a dataframe of fish data rectrieved from get_fish_data()}
}
\value{
A filtered dataframe converting the raw detection data into rows of detections
}
\description{
This function takes a prefiltered detection dataframe from prefilter() and
joins it to fish data downloaded from ERDAPP using the get_fish_data()
function or formatted using the format_fish() function. Detections are then
filtered further based on the date and time of tag release and expected
battery life. Detections occurring before release of the tag or after 2x the
expected battery life are removed.
}
\examples{
# Add fish data to a detection dataframe and filter for only detections
# associated with tagged fish

add_fish(prefiltered_detects, cft_fish)
}
